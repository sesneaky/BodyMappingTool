# Body Mapping Tool

Body Mapping Tool is an engaging way to communicate and track physical feeling (pain/pleasure, emotion/mood) to facilitators, managers, medical doctors, sports coaches, nutritionists, psychological therapists. It aggregates individual and group experiences to support analysis, empathy and team bonding. The journey to emotional self-awareness can be engaging, smart and shareable.

There are two browser applications. The user application (/public/) allows users to draw scribbles and enter demographic data. The admin application (/public/admin/) allows administrators to view multiple scribbles overlaid on each other matching a selection of demographic filters.

Body Mapping Tool is written in ReactJS and node.js. Only the browser code is available here.
