# Body Mapping Tool

The Body Mapping Tool is an engaging way to communicate and track physical feeling (pain/pleasure, emotion/mood) to facilitators, managers, medical doctors, sports coaches, nutritionists, psychological therapists. It aggregates individual and group experiences to support analysis, empathy and team bonding. The journey to emotional self-awareness can be engaging, smart and shareable.
